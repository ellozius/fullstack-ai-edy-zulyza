# 🚀 GETTING STARTED IMMEDIATELY

## Step 1: Project Setup
- Navigate to your project directory: `cd milestone-1-foundation/scientific-calculator`
- Verify the project structure is in place
- Check that all necessary folders and files exist
- Start with the main entry point: `python src/main.py`

## Step 2: Begin Coding
- Open: `src/calculators/basic_calculator.py`
- Implement the BasicCalculator class methods one by one
- Start with the 'add' method, then move to 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'
- Follow the method signatures and docstrings provided
- Test each method as you implement it

## Step 3: Test Your Work
- Run tests to verify functionality: `python -m pytest tests/unit/test_basic_calculator.py -v`
- Check for any failing tests and fix issues
- Ensure all basic operations work correctly
- Validate error handling for edge cases

## Step 4: Iterate and Improve
Follow this development cycle for each feature:
1. Pick one small feature or function to implement
2. Write the code for that specific feature
3. Test the feature thoroughly with various inputs
4. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages
5. Review and refactor if necessary
6. Repeat for the next feature
